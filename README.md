# Just Another Text Editor
  Created by Bethany Proctor 

  ## Description
  This project is a Progressive Web Application for text-editing on- or offline. It can be run in the browser or downloaded for offline work to allow coders to note their code down in any situation. The PWA functionality was very interesting yet difficult to learn. The most challenging aspect of this project was configuring the installation process, but it was also the most rewarding.
